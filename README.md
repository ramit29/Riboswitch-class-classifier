# RiboCLASS
RiboCLASS is used to predict whether a given sequence of a riboswitch is either a Purine or Lysine or Molybdenum co-factor or SAM IV riboswitch. A feed-forward neural network is used with the gradient descent and backpropogation algorithm to predict the class. The feature vector consisted of the mono-nucleotide and di-nucleotide frequencies of the riboswitches. The models accuracy(f-score) on the cross validation data set was observed to be 0.94.
